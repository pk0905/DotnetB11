            <p>Consuming great writing is like listening to a singer. If the performer makes an emotional connection
                with me – even though they miss a few notes – I eagerly lock into the rest of the song and anticipate
                the next performance.

                Your words must be powerful and effective as well if you want to captivate as many of your readers as
                possible.

                Content writing isn’t an easy task. Whether you craft words for B2B or B2C audiences, the challenges can
                be many. I’ve created a diverse set of tips, tools, and resources to aid in shaping and modifying your
                work. It’s not an exhaustive collection. Some ideas may seem familiar. Others will be fresh.

                My hope is that you’ll walk away with some insights or new tools to help address or minimize the content
                creation challenges you face.

                Let’s get to it.

                1. Convey much with few words
                I find inspiration in ad copy that takes little space to reflect a strong message. Sure, you’ll need to
                write much more than a couple of sentences for your content marketing, but simplicity has merit. How
                well you write always sets the stage for what’s to come.

                Creativity can emerge in many ways. Sometimes, it’s a simple starting point. It might be wise to reflect
                the times and a significant sentiment. These examples tap into beauty, memes, a health crisis, and a
                love of pets.

                I was impressed with this line from Dove, “You’re more beautiful than you think.” It’s part of Dove Real
                Beauty Sketches, a six-minute YouTube video with 11 million views since 2013.</p>
